            - Both in urban and rural areas, the number of stroke cases is lower compared to those who have not had a stroke.
            - The distribution between urban and rural areas appears to be similar, with almost the same proportion of stroke and non-stroke cases.

        6. **Smoking Status**:
            - The majority of patients who do not suffer a stroke are non-smokers.

        7. **Work Type**:
            - The majority of patients who do not suffer a stroke work in the private sector.
            - The number of stroke cases is lower in all types of work compared to those who did not experience a stroke, but the difference is not very significant.

        - Men who have been married have a higher percentage of stroke incidence than women who have been married.

        - Men have a higher risk of stroke compared to women. The difference in stroke risk in men or women may be influenced by lifestyle differences, such as smoking habits and higher alcohol consumption in men. In addition, marital status can increase the risk of stroke, especially in men, it can occur due to factors such as stress and family responsibilities.

        **Stroke based on Hypertension and Heart Disease**

        - Patients who have a history of hypertension and also have heart disease are at a very high risk of having a stroke.

        - The association between hypertension and heart disease shows the highest risk for stroke events. This shows that prevention and management efforts for both health conditions are essential to reduce the risk of stroke.

        - Hypertension causes narrowing or rupture of blood vessels in the brain which will result in impaired blood flow to the brain and even cause the death of brain cells.

        The incidence of stroke in patients who have a business (entrepreneur) and live in urban areas is higher than those who live in rural areas.  This suggests that employers may have certain risk factors that increase the incidence of stroke, such as higher stress. In addition, patients who live in cities have a more sedentary lifestyle or higher levels of stress in urban work environments.
