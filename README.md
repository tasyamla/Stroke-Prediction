# Stroke Prediction Model
---
This repository contains the code and documentation for a machine learning project focused on predicting the likelihood of stroke in patients based on various health parameters. The project utilizes a comprehensive dataset that includes patient information such as age, gender, underlying health conditions, and lifestyle factors like smoking status.

# Overview
Stroke is a major health concern and a leading cause of death worldwide, responsible for approximately 11% of all deaths according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Early prediction and diagnosis of stroke can be crucial in preventing fatal outcomes and improving patient survival rates. This project aims to develop a predictive model using machine learning techniques to identify patients at high risk of stroke.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes various features such as:

- **Gender**
- **Age**
- **Hypertension**
- **Heart Disease**
- **Ever Married**
- **Work Type**
- **Residence Type**
- **Average Glucose Level**
- **Body Mass Index (BMI)**
- **Smoking Status**

Each row in the dataset represents a patient and contains the above features, which are used to predict the likelihood of a stroke.

# Objective
The primary goal of this project is to create a reliable and accurate machine learning model that can predict the risk of stroke in patients based on their health information. The model aims to assist healthcare professionals in identifying high-risk individuals, enabling timely interventions to prevent strokes.

# Machine Learning Methods

This project employs a structured approach, including data preprocessing, model definition, training, and evaluation:


**1. Data Preprocessing**
- Split Train - Test Set: The dataset is divided into training and test sets to ensure the model's performance is evaluated on unseen data.
- Handling Missing Values: Missing data is handled appropriately to prevent skewed model results.
- Handling Outliers: Outliers are detected and managed to enhance model accuracy.
- Cardinality: Managing features with high cardinality.
- Correlation: To find out the relationship between each feature and target.
- Data Balancing: Addressing class imbalance to prevent biased predictions.
- Scaling: Standardizing features to ensure uniformity across the dataset.
- Encoding: Transforming categorical variables into numerical formats suitable for model input.

**2. Model Definition**
- K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) Classifier 
- Support Vector Machines (SVM) 
- Decision Tree Classifier 
- Random Forest Classifier 
- Boosting Algorithm (XGB Classifier) 

**3. Model Training**

Training the defined models using the training set and optimizing them using various techniques.

**4. Model Evaluation**
- Metrics: Utilizing F1 score and ROC-AUC to evaluate model performance.
- Train & Test Score: Comparing model performance on both training and test sets.
- Metric Score: Assessing the precision, recall, and F1-score for a balanced evaluation.
- Cross Validation: Ensuring model generalization through cross-validation techniques.
- ROC-AUC Curve: Visualizing model performance across different classification thresholds.

**5. Model Deployment**

The final model, after validation and testing, is deployed using Hugging Face.
